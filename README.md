Constructed a basic genetic algorithm to test the effect of cloning versus crossbreeding on binary numbers. The program has a target gene that it tries to find from running several generations of cloning and crossbreeding. Each generation has 20 chromosomes, and genes are selected to be cloned into the new generation by how closely they match the target gene. Afterwards, more genes are selected to be crossbred into the new generation, until the next generation has 20 chromosomes in it.
